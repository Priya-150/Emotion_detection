Emotion Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a real-time emotion detection system that uses OpenCV and a pre-trained machine learning to detect human emotions from images.

 Features
* Detects 7 emotions: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise**  
* Uses **Haarcascade** for face detection  
* Pre-trained **CNN model** for emotion classification  
* GUI built with **Tkinter** for easy image upload

STEPS TO FOLLOW
Simple Emotion_Detection using Machine Learning
To use our Emotion Detection Model
Just clone or download and unzip our resporatory
install tensorflow and cv2 in the system using pip
run the gui.py file
upload the image in the gui
click on the Detect button to detect the emotion.

 Notes
If no face is detected, try using a clearer image.
If all images show "Sad", check the model accuracy or retrain with a balanced dataset.
To increase accuracy, tweak the scaleFactor and minNeighbors in face detection.
